*Motivation of Machine Learning:-* (Refer Pdf Notes)

Ques:- What is Machine Learnings?
Ans:- Machine learns patterns from the data and tries to replicate same things in future.

*Arthur Samual*:- According to him the subfield of Computer Science that gives computers the  ability to learn without explicitly programmed.

 
*Traditional Programming Paradigm:- (Refer Pdf Notes)

*M.L. Programming Paradigm:- (Refer Pdf Notes)

Ques:- What is Model ?
Ans:-

Famous Person in A.I.:-
(i)-Tom Mitchell
(ii)-Andrew Neg
(iii)-Jofre Hinton(Father of A.I.)


Tom Mitchell :- According to Tom Mitchell a computer program is said to learn from experience DE with respect to some class of Task T and performance measure P if it's performance measure P at task T improves with experience E.

*AI VS ML VS DL VS* :- (Refer Pdf Notes)

*Types of ML*:- 

  (i)- Supervised ML
 (ii)- Un-supervised ML
(iii)- Semi-supervised ML
 (iv)- Reinforcement Learning
 
 (i)- Supervised ML:- (Refer Pdf Notes) If target variable ,tags,level,response variable, dependent variable is given then it is called supervidsed machine learning.
 
 Types of supervised learning:-
 
  (i)- Regression :- y is continuous where y is targer variable.
 (ii)- Classification :- If given data  y is discrete then we do prediction based on given discrete data.
 
Regression:- SLR ,MLR,Polynomial,Lasso ,Ridge,KNN,DT,RF(Bagging is example of random Forest vs Boosting), XGR , SVM,SVR

Classification:- Logistic Regression , Multi-class Classification, Naive Based Classification ,KNN ,DTC

*After Unsupervised Learning:-* PCA

(ii)- Unsupervised Learning:- y is not present there.With similar faces,shapes to seggrigate something.In unsupervised learning you have different interpretation. Segmenting in different groups. Unsupervised learning can be converted into supervised learning.


*Informed Business Decision

*Unlabel when y is not given and if y is given then it is label.

* In unsupervised learning either you drop label coloumn and consider complete data as USL problem statement.

(iii)- Semi-supervised Learning:- Combination of supervised and un-supervised learning. It doesnot have any it's own algorithm.

(iv)- Reinforcement Learning:- Reward Signal and Negative Signal and this is called envoirnment.  (Refer Pdf Notes)
