*Variance :- Hitting away from the target (High Bias -Low Variance) so Variance is spread from the target you are looking at.
*Bias :- How close to the target you are (in figure)

*Data Encoding :- Some sort of convention for conversion of string to numerical.

*We will use that feature which has highest co-relation.

*Null/Missing Value Treatment :- (Refer Pdf Notes)

** How to deal with missing values ? 

  (i)- Never do missing value treatment without consulting to the business team.

 (ii)- If missing value < 1% and data is large then you can drop a missing value.

(iii)- If data is small and you don't want to drop the missing values (be it large or small), you will do imputations.

* (Refer Pdf Notes)

* Replace with -1 or number that is not possible marks for that column.

 (iv)-  Create a new column with a flag if the column is missing and impute some constant value in the missing column.
 
 Exp:- (Refer Pdf Notes)
 
 (v)-  If missing value in column >30 % then drop the column.  Noise --> Data different from general or occuring unwanted.
 
 (vi)- If data is time series then you can not replace with mean , median , mode. Impute with previous observed value or impute with next observed value or average of previous and next (Interpolation) or moving average.

*Anamoly:- Those data points which occurs very rare.
*Outliers:- Which deviates from usual data.
